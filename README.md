# 🎓 Project Management Capstone – Final Project Artifacts

This repository contains the final project deliverables for the **Project Management Capstone** course, part of the [IBM Project Management Professional Certificate (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-project-management).

## 📌 Project Overview

As the capstone of the program, this project simulates a complete project lifecycle, from initiation to close-out. I assumed the role of **Project Manager**, applying both **predictive (waterfall)** and **adaptive (agile)** methodologies. The deliverables represent core project management artifacts typically produced in real-world engagements.

These documents can be used to showcase foundational project management competencies to prospective employers.
